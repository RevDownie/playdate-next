# playdate-next
A Playdate game written in Zig using Windows

## Game Overview
Inspired by shooters like Minigore this will be a simple horde survival game where the player moves around and uses a crank controlled gatling gone to take down enemies

##TODO List
* Figure out whether the velocity is game state or system state and refactor
* Simulator hot reload of DLL
* Scrolling camera to follow player
* Bullet projectiles
* Enemies
* Auto targetting? Or button to switch target?
* Split up main.zig as it gets too large
* Level background (isometric tiles?)
* Movement bounds
* Look at changing acceleration to be floating point
* Actual character sprite and animation
* Launcher tile
* Running on device
